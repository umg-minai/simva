R Implementation of the simple three compartment model for volatile
anaesthetics described in
[Cowles et al. 1973](https://doi.org/10.1016/0010-4825(73)90004-8).

## Bootstrap

We assume you have `guix` installed to generate an isolated development
environment in the following way:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/umg-minai/simva.git
cd simva
echo "$(pwd)" >> ~/.config/guix/shell-authorized-directories
guix shell
```

If network access (e.g. checking CRAN etc.) is needed:

```bash
CURL_CA_BUNDLE="/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt" guix shell --network
```
